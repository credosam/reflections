What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It becomes a git directory. So that we can make a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area so that all the files that have to committed can be done in 1 commit itself.
