What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It becomes a git directory. So that we can make a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area so that all the files that have to committed can be done in 1 commit itself.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
We can check the staging area evry time by git status and once a logical change has been made we can commit that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When we are not sure of the functionality that we want to introduce and we want to keep our previous code intact so that we can return to that code if something goes wrong.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps us keep track of commits on a particular branch and we can easily understand what actions have been made.
