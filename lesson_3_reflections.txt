When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are more than one person contributing to a particular project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be conflicts we should deal with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - cloning a repo on github
clone - cloning a repo on local
branch - creating another branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can see the changes that have been done on the remote and locally, compare them and take proper actions to resolve a conflict if there is one.
